# admob-test
Test if your admob Units (Interstitial, Banner and Video) are working easily just by inputing the unit in textbox.
You can download the sample apk just to test your units or fork this repo do edit source.

The base code is base on android official Interstitial test code, i only create this for confortability in testing your units so you wont need to fork many code to test

Only INTERTSTITIAL BANNER and REWARDED VIDEO is supported for now without any third mediation sdk implemented.
